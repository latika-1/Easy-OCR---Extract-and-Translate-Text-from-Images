Image to text conversion refers to the process of extracting textual information from an image. It involves using optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to analyze the image and identify the characters and words present in it. This project uses the Gradio and EasyOCR libraries to create a web-based application that allows users to upload an image and extract the text and translate according to the users known language . It utilizes the PIL library for image processing and numpy for array operations. The extracted text is displayed to the user using the Gradio interface.
